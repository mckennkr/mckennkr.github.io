Katherine McKenna is a historian of early modern Europe with a focus on Italy, women, and gender. She received her Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in August 2019 and is a 2019-2020 Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Digital and Public Humanities. Her dissertation, entitled “Fashioning Adria, Fashioning Femininity: Venetian Women and the Radicalization of the Querelle des Femmes, 1550–1635,” explores the movement of secular Venetian women into print as well as the feminist turn of the local querelle in connection with changes to the Venetian book market, civic crisis, and state politics.

To complete this project, Katherine received a 2018-2019 finishing fellowship from the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities. She also benefited from research support provided by Vanderbilt's College of Arts and Science, the Vanderbilt Department of History, and the UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. Katherine has presented her work at the MLA, Newberry Library, Sixteenth Century Society and Conference, and the RSA. She is excited to announce that her first article, “Women in the Garden: The Decameron Reimagined in Moderata Fonte’s Il merito delle donne” came out with Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal in Spring 2019.
